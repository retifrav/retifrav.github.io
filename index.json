Лучше поздно, чем никогда.\nНу и стал смотреть, как в нём обрабатывать ошибки, точнее исключения. В ASP.NET Web Forms в глобальном классе Global.asax.cs был метод Application_Error, где можно было ловить все необработанные исключения.

Я предложил Redmine, так как был уже с ним знаком по прошлой работе. Альтернатив (кроме SharePoint) никто не предложил, потому решено было ставить Redmine.\nКак вы помните, от интернета мы изолированы, что вносит определённые проблемы в установку ПО. Здесь эти проблемы вновь себя проявили, но слава небесам, мы такие не одни на планете, и уже есть решение на такие ситуации - это Bitnami Stack, то есть установка всё-в-одном: и БД, и само приложение, и сопутствующие необходимые компоненты, вроде Ruby on Rails и прочего, и всё это ставится в один каталог, а самое главное - не требуется соединение с интернетом.\n","permalink":"https://retifrav.github.io/blog/2015/04/19/updating-bitnami-redmine-stack/","title":"Обновление Bitnami Redmine Stack"},{"content":"У меня есть один сайт, который находится у хостера Бегет. Среди прочих условий тарифного плана есть ограничение по CP - некие условные единицы нагрузки на сервер - значение, которое превышать нельзя. Точнее, можно, но тогда потребуется перейти на тариф уровнем выше.\nПонятно, что надо как-то за нагрузкой следить. Посмотреть её можно у них в личном кабинете, но каждый раз туда лазить неудобно. Зато хостер предоставил API для доступа к некоторым функциям личного кабинета, среди которых есть и просмотр нагрузки.
