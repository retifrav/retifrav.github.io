    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Thanks for contacting Microsoft support, my name is Jennifer C.. Please allow me a few moments while I review the information you provided.</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Case number: 1382107965</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Hi there!</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Hello</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">I hope you are doing well out there today.</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Quite fine</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">I see... Let me go ahead and check on your Case ID. Please allow me 2-3 minutes for this. Thank you.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Thank you for patiently waiting. Upon checking on your case, it shows that you are having issues configuring the projector through network to your Windows 10 PC, is that correct?</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Yes</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">As you can see, I have a question about connecting to a projector on Windows 10 via network by specifying its IP address. I can't find this functionality in Windows 10. Previous support specialist said that it is available in the newest Windows 10 release 1703. I asked for a step-by-step instruction how to do it in this new Windows 10 1703 after I will upgrade to it,, and this specialist sent me an e-mail. But this e-mail did not contain such instruction, it was just general info about updating Windows 10 to this 1703 release. So, my issue is still not resolved, and I still cannot find such functionality even in the newest Windows 10 1703</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">So, again, my question: is it even possible, to connect to a projector via network by manually specifying its IP address on Windows 10? On Windows 7 it is possible, I can do it with no problem.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Thank you for all the information you provided. May I ask, what is the brand of your projector?</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Previous specialist asked this question already, and it is not related to the projector at all, this is the Windows functionality. Again, my question: is it possible on Windows 10? Because on Windows 7 it is possible disregarding the projectors brand, it works with any projector</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">I only need to understand if Windows 10 has such functionality</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Let me go ahead and check on this with my resources so that I can provide you an accurate information regarding this. Please allowm me 2-3 minutes for this.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Thank you for patiently waiting. Upon checking with my resources, any device should be auto detected by your PC as long as you are connected to the same network.</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Yes. But in cases when auto-detection fails to find a projector, Windows 7 provides an ability to specify the IP address of a projector manually. Can Windows 10 do the same?</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Because I couldn't find it on Windows 10</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">But I have it on Windows 7, and it works just fine</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">I need it on Windows 10 too. Is it there?</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Or auto-detection is the only way?</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Let me further check on it. Please bear with me. Thank you.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Thank you for waiting.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Upon checking here with my support, the only way for now in Windows 10 1703 is auto-detection.</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Thank you for the information. Just as I thought so. I will live a feature request then on the Feedback Hub.</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">leave</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Bye</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Let me give you the article that saying that it was removed in Windows 10</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Oh, okay</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">or I will send it into your email instead</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">I can wait here</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Thank you very much for your kind patience.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">oh okay</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">one second please</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s3"><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/how-to-project-my-laptop-screen-on-a-network/af02b0ff-7584-47ce-9079-98a2e4da382b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/how-to-project-my-laptop-screen-on-a-network/af02b0ff-7584-47ce-9079-98a2e4da382b<span class="s11"></span></a></span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Click on the article please</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">at the latter part it says - Unfortunately, NEC does not supply a driver to replace the Connect to a Network Projector feature (netproj.exe) that was in Windows 7 and 8 but that appears to be missing in Windows 10.</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Yeah, but that's hardly an official article, it's just a forum reply, I saw similar ones all over the internet, and I just wanted to get an official statement that this feature is not available on Windows 10</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">And previous support specialist assured me that is is available in Windows 10 1703, so I had to update t see that it's not true</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Anyway, thanks for your help, bye</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">We will be further check on this for you and will send you helpful links regarding this issue.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">I will raise a ticket on this matter so that higher level Engineers of Microsoft can clarify and check on this issue</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Good, thank you for that</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">We'll be using the same case number 1382107965</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Ok</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Thank you very much for your patience and understanding</span></p>
