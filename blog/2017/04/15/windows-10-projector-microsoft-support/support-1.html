    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Thanks for contacting Microsoft support, my name is Cezka Marie D.. Please allow me a few moments while I review the information you provided.</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Hello. On Windows 7 it is possible to connect to a projector by its IP address. But I can't find the same functionality on Windows 10, there is only auto-discovery and there is no possibility to specify IP address of the projector manually</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">How can I connect to a projector by specifying its IP address on Windows 10? Keyboard shortcut Win + P only gives me auto-discovery option, I cannot "tell" it to use particular IP address. And Windows 7 allows to do that</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">hello there, how's your day going? :)</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Hi, not bad</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">let me go ahead and review your issue sir.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">please give me 2-3 minutes.</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Sure</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">I understand how urgent this concern to be fixed and since you have me here, let me see the best that I can do to help.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">I also need your help as we need to work on this hand in hand okay?</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Of course</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">That's awesome. By the way, my name is Cezka and I'm speaking with?</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">It's Ivan :)</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Thanks Ivan. Mine is Cezka. Nice to meet you. :)</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">here's your case number for future reference: 1382107965</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">So I will be asking few questions to narrow down the concern and get into the resolution right away, okay?</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Yep</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Have you made any changes in your computer such as updates or is there any error message being captured the moment you tried to connect to a  projector by specifying its IP address on Windows 10?</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">No, you got it wrong. I simply cannot find such functionality - to connect to a projector knowing its IP address. On Windows 7 it's pretty straightforward, I'll show you:</span></p>
    <p class="p10"><span class="s8"><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kDEWa.png">https://i.stack.imgur.com/kDEWa.png<span class="s4"></span></a></span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">but there is no such thing on Windows 10</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">or is it?</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">That's the question</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">I'm sorry but I'm unable to check the link your provided me,</span></p>
    <p class="p11"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Thanks for letting me know. So since there's no changes made prior encountering the issue, as your personal technician, I would like to completely set your expectation that we will do basics that may resolve the issue and I'll make sure the step by step instruction will be given as simple as ABC. In case that the issue will not be sorted with the basics then we will discuss different options later on. </span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">But you're missing the point here. The question is: is it even possible on Windows 10?</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">To connect to a projector knowing its IP address?</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">let me go ahead and check</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Okay</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">please allow me 2-3 minutes to check on my resources</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">hello there, thank you for patiently waiting.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">May I know what is the brand of the projector?</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Epson</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">But it's not related to the projector at all</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">It's Windows functionality</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">there is such functionality on Windows 7, it works with all projectors brands</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">And there is no su in Windows 10, apparently</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">such</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">I see. I think there are some support on Epson about network connectivity. If I may ask, what Build of windows 10 do you have?</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">There are some functions that was changed in windows 10 that might deferred some commands on lower versions of Windows.</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Again, Epson has nothing to do with that.</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">And the build of my Windows 10 is: 10.0.14393</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Again, the question is pretty simple: "Is it possible to connect to a projector via network knowing its IP address by specifying this IP address manually? On any build of Windows 10?"</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">I see. I suggest you run windows update so that some functions will be allowed. We can check if it will let you have that configuration on Build 1607</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">My Windows 10 is up to date and there are no updates available</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">It is possible in Build 1607</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Ah, okay</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">I see</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Can you send me the ABC instructions for how to do it in Windows 10 build 1607 then? :)</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">I would be really grateful</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">sure, we can go ahead and send the email for the instructions.</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Great!</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Do you have a preferred email address so that I can send it to you?</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">ivan@hotmail.com</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">all possible resources I will search it for you, usually it might take 10 - 15 minutes</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">No rush here</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">no need to worry, rest assure I will send it to you</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">:) good</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s8">Thank you</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s2">you're very much welcome</span></p>
